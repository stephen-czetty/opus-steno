<p># Episode 1 #</p><p><br></p><p>## Getting started with Golang ##</p><p><br></p><p>Hi! This will be my first start with golang, and I will be recording this so that you can follow along.</p><p>Besides some initial research, I know basically zero about go and how to best use it. &nbsp;That's the fun</p><p>part, though, and I hope that at by the end of this series, both you and I will have learned something.</p><p><br></p><p>The project I have in mind I hope will allow me to explore most of the features and syntax of Go by the</p><p>time it reaches its conclusion. &nbsp;If it is actually useful in the real world, or if there is already</p><p>an existing and better project that does the same thing, well, that's not really important. &nbsp;My main goal</p><p>is to learn and become proficient with Go as a programming language.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope this project can do that. &nbsp;Maybe I'll have to do another one to explore other aspects of the language,</p><p>but I won't know that until I've progressed much farther than the zero I'm at right now.</p><p><br></p><p>So what do I want to write? &nbsp;The basic idea is to write a utility that can hide arbritary data inside of</p><p>an OPUS-encoded audio file, without effecting audio quality. &nbsp;OPUS makes that pretty easy, with the</p><p>support for padding at the end of each of its frames. &nbsp;I would also like to explore another mode, by re-using</p><p>the least-signifigant bit of the encoded audio itself, and maybe a hybrid option of the two. &nbsp;I will consider</p><p>the project a success if the first mode is working well, but will relish the challenge of modes two and three.</p><p><br></p><p>(Cut to OPUS documentation, describe the details, unscripted (?))</p><p><br></p><p>I intend to start with a test project and then get started with code to read and parse the header of an OGG</p><p>stream. &nbsp;At this stage, I only want to be able to read the basic metadata stored in the header. &nbsp;From there I will</p><p>go on to read the other embedded metadata.</p><p><br></p><p>So let's go ahead and jump right in.</p>
